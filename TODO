New features:
  - LCD Ghosting
  - Touch and Android
  - some form of hardware selection
  - API for apps to enumerate hardware at run-time, and read info about it
    - this ties into colors, as there's no way to enumerate colors as names or even get a numberof colors
    - This way, accessing unavailable hardware/vram pages can be avoided
  - config file
  - Separate environment for each app, and an API for inter-app communication
    - Right now apps all share the same global environment, and so do hardware. this could cause havoc if something sets a global variable and something else reads it 
  - individual hardware component scaling

Improvements:
  - mouse control needs improvement
  - clean up the mess of a filesystem
    - rom/ folder needs a better name, and maybe to be moved?
  √ Launching an app from another app
    √ a launcher would be nice
      - improve the launcher, and maybe begin work on a simple multitasking OS
  - Replace btn array with something else
    - Might as well be a function since you can't iterate over it
      - maybe a function that returns a table you _can_ iterate over?

Bug Fixes/Glaring Problems:
  - Checking of hardware sanity
  - Fix the roundabout and frankly hideous way that graphics pages are selected
    √ kind of fixed?
  - Fix it so that loading new hardware sets minw and minh of the window context

Small things:
  √ Stop from changing to a cozy level which would give a smaller scale than the lowest
    - improvement: allow cozy level to be higher than max, but don't _change to_ a cozy level higher than max

Way in the future plans
  - Networking
  - Actual games and software for the vPET line
