New features:
  - some form of hardware selection
  - API for apps to enumerate hardware at run-time, and read info about it
    - this ties into colors, as there's no way to enumerate colors as names or even get a numberof colors
    - This way, accessing unavailable hardware/vram pages can be avoided
  - config file
    - file in app folder that initializes the game before Lua code is run?
      - it could: load pages... I forgot what else...
  - Save functionality
  √ Separate environment for each app
    - an API for inter-app communication
      - inter-app communication could use the event system
  √ individual hardware component scaling
  - LCD Overhaul
    √ Ghosting
    - Image-Pixel improvement
  - Implement D-Pad input unit
    - needs its own entry in hw.input most likely
    - images for each direction, disallow up+down & left+right
    - other image set-ups?
  - Library, Lua file, and generic file loading
    - Perhaps a lib/ folder for shared libraries
  √ PRNG state for each instance
    √ or, one shared state, which can't be affected by appss
  - Touch and Android
    - Need to improve mouse support first
  - begin work on a simple multitasking OS
  - os.time etc
  - generalize font code to work for loading and colorized drawing of 1-bit images

Improvements:
  - clean up the mess of a filesystem
    - rom/ folder needs a better name, and maybe to be moved?
  √ Replace btn array with something else
    √ Might as well be a function since you can't iterate over it
    - add a function that returns a table you _can_ iterate over?
      - this is hardware enumeration. these problems are all waiting to solve themselves
  - mouse control needs improvement

Bug Fixes/Glaring Problems:
  - Fix image loading/drawing/etc to work with displays with different palettes
  - Checking of hardware sanity
  - Fix the roundabout and frankly hideous way that graphics pages are selected
    √ kind of fixed?
    - but it's still bad, just different, less bad bad
  √ Fix it so that loading new hardware sets minw and minh of the window context
    - Move this (and all changes to global state) out of the loadhardware function
  - canvases can be cleared by changing window mode, so this has been disabled temporarily
    - requires refactoring of hardware data structure
  - disallow hardware overlapping
    - currently this could cause bugs with buttons, screens, you name it

Small things:
  √ Stop from changing to a cozy level which would give a smaller scale than the lowest
    - improvement: allow cozy level to be higher than max, but don't _change to_ a cozy level higher than max

Way in the future plans
  - Add BitOp binary operators
  - Networking
  - Actual games and software for the vPET line
    - Aquarium-type game with boids for the fish?
      - A demo at least
    - Need an actual pet game
      - Need os.time to run simulation from when the program is closed, like Animal Crossing
  - Visual hardware editor?

Finished:
  √ Launching an app from another app
    √ a launcher would be nice
      √ improve the launcher
