New features:
  - Ghosting
  - Touch and Android
  √ Launching an app from another app
    √ a launcher would be nice
  - what about selecting hardware?
    - and determining what hardware you are on at run-time
    - this ties into colors, as there's no way to enumerate colors as names or even get a numberof colors

Improvements:
  - mouse control needs improvement
  - clean up the mess of a filesystem
  √ named colors
    - could still be improved
  - Interface for apps to read info about the hardware they're running on

Bug Fixes/Glaring Problems:
  - Checking of hardware sanity
  - Stopping crashes which occur from accessing unavailable hardware/vram pages
  - Fix the roundabout and frankly hideous way that graphics pages are selected
    √ kind of fixed?
  - Fix it so that loading new hardware sets minw and minh

Small things:
  - Stop from changing to a cozy level which would give a smaller scale than the lowest
